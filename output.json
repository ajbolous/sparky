Following are a few examples of technical and business problems we aim to address. - Provide a solution for optimizing the risk machine learning model ensemble (covering the entire end-to-end advertiser funnel including detection, decisioning, enforcement and remediation) through optimization of the current model portfolio and individual models. - Minimize the impact of the prolonged financial fraud feedback loop. - Improve models\u2019 measurement and performance. - Optimize data/label strategy. - Optimize balance between specific targeted model strategy and broad umbrella model strategy to optimize for short and long term benefitsLead Research and Introduction of Advanced Technologies: - Collaborate with Financial Integrity's senior ML Engineers to lead the research and introduction of deep learning and Large Language Model (LLM) technologies. - Remain current on industry-wide advancements in ML and introduce relevant advancements in Financial Risk ManagementCollaborate on Next-Generation ML Architecture: - Work closely with financial harms principals and risk management tech leads to deliver the next-generation ML architecture for Meta's risk management system. - Collaborate with Principal ML engineers from across the company to adopt best industry and Meta practices within the FRM team. - Resolve or mitigate design dilemmas, balancing business and technical trade-offs. - Identify and initiate opportunities for collaboration and impact with other organizations at MetaIdentify and Initiate New Business Opportunities: - Collaborate with Meta FinTech, Central Integrity and Core Ads Growth partnerships to identify and initiate new business opportunities based on third-party capabilities. - Conduct proof of concept for different opportunities and initiate integrations to enhance business performanceGrow Other Senior ML Engineers - Actively invest in the growth of other senior ML engineers through goal-driven formal and informal mentorship. Provide regular feedback to other engineers regarding their technical workMinimum Qualifications:Extensive experience in supporting and evolving a portfolio of ML models that deliver on critical business goalsPreferred Qualifications:Experience working with ML models in financial risk or similar financial contextsAbout Meta:Meta builds technologies that help people connect, find communities, and grow businesses. When Facebook launched in 2004, it changed the way people connect. Apps like Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp further empowered billions around the world. Now, Meta is moving beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented and virtual reality to help build the next evolution in social technology.
